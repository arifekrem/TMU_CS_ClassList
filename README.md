This project is a web application designed to help students at TMU (Toronto Metropolitan University) choose their courses based on prerequisites and course sequences. The site displays a visual tree of courses, organized by year, allowing students to easily navigate through the required classes for their Computer Science degree.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the course tree.
- `index.css`: The CSS file for styling the course tree.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file providing interactivity to the course tree.
